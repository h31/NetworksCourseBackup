Name:	Time and Love
Author:	Vidyapati 

As I guard my honor,
My love in a foreign land
Ravishes beauties
Who belong to others.
Safely he will come,
But he has left me dead.

O traveler, tell him
That my youth wastes away...
If time goes on
Life too will go
And never shall we love again...
