Name:	What Is Life
Author:	Samuale Taylor Coleridge

Resembles Life what once was held of Light,
Too ample in itself for human sight ?

An absolute Self-an element ungrounded-
All, that we see, all colours of all shade

By encroach of darkness made ?-

Is very life by consciousness unbounded ?
And all the thoughts, pains, joys of mortal breath,
A war-embrace of wrestling Life and Death ?
